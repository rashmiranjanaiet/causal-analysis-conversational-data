# Causal Analysis and Interactive Reasoning over Conversational Data

This project performs causal analysis over multi-turn conversational transcripts.
All explanations are grounded in dialogue-level evidence extracted directly from the transcripts.

## Problem Statement
Large-scale conversational systems record outcome events (escalations, complaints, refunds),
but do not explain which dialogue turns caused them.

## Our Approach
- Use conversational transcripts as the only data source
- Identify dialogue-level causal factors
- Extract exact dialogue spans as evidence
- Support multi-turn context-aware queries

## Tasks Covered
- Task 1: Query-driven causal explanation with evidence
- Task 2: Multi-turn context-aware reasoning

## Data Source
Conversational transcripts provided in JSON format.

## How to Use
Run Task 1 and Task 2 scripts to generate explanations.
